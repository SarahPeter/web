<h3> Introduction </h3>

<p> The movie Perfect Blue was released August 20, 1999 by Satoshi Kon. 
It is critically acclaimed on Rotton Tomatoes and is deemed one of the best movies of all time (at least in the genre of anime). 
The movie is based on the novel Perfect Blue: Complete Metamorphosis and it was the Kon's debut movie. The film follows the journey of Mimi Kirigoe, 
a former pop star in a girl group called CHAM, who makes the ultimate decision to switching her career to acting. However, in the process she finds herself becoming the victim of a stalker who 
is a die hard fan of Mimi's pop past. As this whole dillema is going on, Mimi finds herself struggling in her new acting career because although she lands herself 
a (small) role in a new show, a series of murders occur at the same time. Mimi loses her grasp of reality and grays the lines between the plot of the show she's acting in and her own life. 
 Suddenly, the show she is playing in called Double Bind starts to manifest in her own life where she cannot tell what is on a script or what is occuring in her day to day life.
She has become haunted by a ghost, a version of her past cheery pop idol self and these murders are all correlated to men who have tried to modify Mimi's public image.
