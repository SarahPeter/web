<p> Rumi Hidaka: She is the deuteragonist of the movie and is Mimi's manager who helps her with her assimilation of the acting industry. Rumi found herself in Mimi because 
she also was once a pop idol before changing careers. So, as Rumi witnesses Mimi and the absolute atrocities she has to go through such as sexual assault, Rumi slowly 
becomes delusioned and thinks she is the "real" Mimi and must restore her reputation. She was the one behind the murders and her motives were all in the name of revenge 
for the sake of Mimi's image. Rumi was doing this behind the scenes as she encouraged the stalker to murder Mimi which led to Mimi's slow descent of madness. Finally, 
this is all revealed to Mimi thus Rumi and her finally face each other in the climax of the movie as they Rumi chases Mimi around the city looking to kill her and become the "real" Mimi. 
Luckily, Mimi prevails and Rumi is sent to a mental facility where she most likely struggles with Dissociative Identity Disorder which created a split in Rumi's mind as there her reality and her alter of "real" Mimi. </p>

<p> Mamoru Uchida (aka Me-Mania) : He is the secondary antagonist and is the stalker who is later killed by Rumi. Mamoru has an obsession with Mimi to the point of worship, 
as his room is a shrine plastered with a myriad of photos of her. He is seen as a freak or a weirdo because of his grotesque face. Over the course of the movie, his obession with her grows and grows 
by constantly following her with a tape recorder, creating a website of her so other fans can view, and buying magazines of her. Due to Rumi's conditioning, he is convinced that
the actual Mimi is a mere imposter of the "real" Mimi thus he proceeds to find her and try to assaulti her until Mimi knocks him unconscious. Rumi finishes the job later and brutally murders him. </p>
