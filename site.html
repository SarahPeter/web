<h1> Perfect Blue: A Perfect Movie </h1> 

<h2> Landing Page </h2> 

<body>
<p> This site is an analysis on one of my favorite movies that has changed how I view fame and pop culture. Although, it
is not the most modern movie, it's themes are timeless and deeply disturbing. I broke up my analysis of Perfect Blue into 
three parts. Firstly, you will be introduced to the movie, then there's an exploration of each of the main characters, and lastly
my final take on the movie and how it still stands the test of time. Honestly, this is a movie I suggest everyone should watch,
 not only for its stunning animation and use of colors, but as well as its music score, chilling characters, and its plot that 
 disorients even the most vigilant movie critics.
